# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
Import the required library (numpy) to perform matrix operations.
### Step 2: 
Define the matrix A for which you want to calculate the rank.
### Step 3: 
Use the function np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) to compute the rank of the matrix.
### Step 4: 
Print the calculated rank as the output.
## Program:

```python
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: Rithika R
#RegisterNumber:212224240136

import numpy as np

a=np.array([[1,2,3],[3,6,9]])
solution=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(solution)
```
## Output:
